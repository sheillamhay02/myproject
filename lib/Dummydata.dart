    ingredients:
          "Pizza Dough\n"
          "3.5 g (½ sachet) dried yeast\n"
          "½ tsp sugar\n"
          "125 ml lukewarm water (not hot)\n"
          "200 g plain flour All-purpose is good enough, plus extra to dust\n"
          "1 tsp salt\n"
          "1½ tbsps. olive oil\n"

          "For the Topping\n"
          "125 g (Tomato) sauce\n"
          "170 g shredded  cheese\n"
          "75 g sliced ham cut into smaller pieces\n"
          "80 g pineapple chunks canned \n"
    ,
    steps:
          "1. Whisk yeast sugar and water in a jug. Stand for 5 minutes or until frothy.\n"
          "2. Place flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre. Pour in the yeast mixture and oil.\n"
          "3. Using your hands, mix the dough until it comes together and is smooth.\n"
          "4. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 2/3 minutes\n"
          "5. Make the kneaded dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl turning the dough around to lightly cover the whole surface with the oil and cover with cling wrap.\n"
          "6. Set aside in a warm place to rise for 30 minutes to an hour until it doubles in size.\n"
          "7. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently for another 5/8 minutes or until smooth.\n"
          "8. Cover with a damp clean tea towel and allow to rest for 30 mins\n"
          "9. Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Gas Mark9 and place the oven rack on the lowest shelf. Place a large flat upturned baking tray on the rack to heat up. (Needs to be large enough to hold your Pizza)\n"
          "10. Once the dough has rested knock it with your fists to knock the air out of it and roll out pizza base on a floured surface to the desired size to about 1cm thick\n"
          "11. Line another flat up-turned baking tray with a sheet of baking parchment (this will make it easier to transfer to the oven) and sprinkle it with flour\n"
